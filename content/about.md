### Purpose
This site started as a simple project to learn the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) web framework. I chose the topic because I have a lot of notes that are easy to turn into content without committing to anything overly ambitious, and because I already owned the domain name.

### Tracking and User Data
We use [Goat Counter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) for easy web analytics with no tracking of personal data. You can opt out by blocking Javascript, or by blocking the bitcoinplumbers.goatcounter.com domain. If this site becomes successful we'll selfhost instead of relying on the free personal offering.

Right now I'm just curious to know if anyone visits the site.

### Hosting Infrastructure
We host on Netlify, which pulls from the public Github repo [https://github.com/thinkmassive/BitcoinPlumbers](https://github.com/thinkmassive/BitcoinPlumbers).
